# PAF-593-project

## Overview

This is the project page for my final project for PAF 593.

## Folders

There are two folders:

  * The rodeo folder-this folder contains the cleaned data and the files to render the final report.
  
  * The wrangling folder-this contains the raw data and the scripts to prepare the data for analysis (that is, the rodeo folder).
