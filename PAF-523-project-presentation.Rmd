### Introduction and Problem
* Crime is mainly a group phenomenon
  * Research and policy has focused on co-offending networks

\vspace{2mm}

* Important structural properties of co-offending networks
  * Reachability
  * Clustering
  
  
### Project Goal
* Examine reachability and clustering in co-offending networks

\vspace{2mm}

* Develop and pursue an open-science approach to analyzing co-offending networks in Phoenix


### Project Methodology
* Data Acquisition and Workflow
  * Data were downloaded from the City of Phoenix [Open Data Portal](https://www.phoenixopendata.com/dataset/arrests)
  * Co-offending defined as arrests between two or more individuals 

\vspace{2mm}

* All project documents were stored on a GitHub repository
  * [https://github.com/jacobtnyoung/PAF-593-project](https://github.com/jacobtnyoung/PAF-593-project)


### Project Methodology

\end{figure}


### Project Methodology
* Network Construction
  * A two-mode network: incidents (i.e. arrests) and individuals (i.e. people arrested together)  \vspace{2mm}
  * Defined as: $G=(N,M,L)$, where G is the graph and is defined by two node sets N={n_1,n_2…,n_g} and M={m_1,m_2…,m_g} and an edge set: L={l_1,l_2…,l_L}

\vspace{2mm}

  * There are N nodes in the first set, M nodes in the second set, and L lines/edges in the network.


### Project Methodology
* Network Measures
  * Reachability
    * Inverse of the distance between the two nodes

\vspace{2mm}

  * Clustering
    * Clustering coefficient defined as: $\frac{4 \times C_4}{L_3}$, where $C_4$ is defined as a cycle and $L_3$ defines a 3-path structure
    * Higher values of the clustering coefficient indicate greater overlap in shared co-offenders


### Analytic Approach
* Descriptive analysis of the reachability scores and clustering coefficient for the co-offending networks by year


### Results

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width = 5cm]{/Users/jyoung20/Dropbox (ASU)/GitHub_repos/PAF-593-project/PAF-523-images/table-1-image.png}
    \caption{Descriptive Information for Co-Offending Networks}
\end{figure}

* Average number of incidents per year was 5,874 

\vspace{2mm}

* Average number of individuals involved in those events was 9,466

\vspace{2mm}

* General decline in co-offending from 2018 to 2023


### Results: Description of Reachability for Co-Offending Networks

\begin{figure}

    \caption{Description of Reachability for Co-Offending Networks}
\end{figure}

\vspace{2mm}

* Average reachability is 6.45 
  * Interpretation: The average individual can reach 6.45 other individuals through their co-arrest history

\vspace{2mm}

* The trend over time has been for reachability to remain roughly similar from 2018-2023


### Results: Description of Clustering for Co-Offending Networks

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width = 2cm]{/Users/jyoung20/Dropbox (ASU)/GitHub_repos/PAF-593-project/PAF-523-images/table-3-image.png}
    \caption{Description of Clustering for Co-Offending Networks}
\end{figure}

\vspace{2mm}

* Average clustering is 0.02

\vspace{2mm}

* Clustering is very low, suggesting that there is very little overlap in co-offenders 


### Results: Description of Clustering for Co-Offending Networks (cont.)

* But, an increase in clustering from 2018 (i.e. 0.007) to 2023 (i.e. 0.025)
  * May be indicative of an increase in the tendency for co-offenders to trust other co-offenders


### Discussion and Policy Recommendations
* Results show an increase in clustering from 2018 to 2023

  * Clustering and trust are important in co-offending networks as these structures may facilitate group solidarity and greater criminal organization
  
  * Networks where there is high clustering tend to create modularity or sets of individuals that are only connected to members of that set. 

\vspace{2mm}
  
* The **policy recommendation** is that agencies focus greater attention on the mechanisms that may lead to the observed increase in clustering.


### Discussion and Policy Recommendations
* Developed an open-science approach to examining adult arrest data from the City of Phoenix Open Data Portal
 * Shows importance of reproducible results
 * Provides a framework that can be updated as more data are generated
